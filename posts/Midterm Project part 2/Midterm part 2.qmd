#Easier problems

Problem 1: List all of the odd numbers from 1 to 100. you could use the seq() function How could you do this without using the seq() function? Consider using the mod function %%, which evaluates whether or not there is a remainder when dividing one number by another.

```{r}
for (i in 1:100){
  if(i%%2)
    print(i)
}


```

Problem 2 : Generate 100 random numbers within a specific range runif can do this

```{r}

runif(100,1,100)

```

Problem 3: Create a variable that stores a 20x20 matrix of random numbers

```{r}
random_num <-matrix(runif(400, min=3,max=45), nrow = 20, ncol=20)


```

#Harder problems

Problem 1: FizzBuzz List the numbers from 1 to 100 with the following constraints.

This question can be solved using for loop and if else statements

```{r}
fizzb <- c(1:100)
for (i in 1:length(fizzb)){
  fizzb[i] <-i
  if(i%%3 == 0 & i%%5== 0){
    fizzb[i] ="FizzBuzz"
  } else if (i%%3 ==0){
    fizzb[i] ="Fizz"
  }
else if (i%%5 ==0 )
  fizzb[i] = "Buzz"
}


```

Problem 2:

```{r}
a<-runif(10000000,0,100)
hist(a)




```

Problem 3: 
Assume that a pair of dice are rolled. Using monte carlo-simulation, compute the probabilities of rolling a 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, respectively.

```{r}

dice1 <- replicate(1000,(sample(1:6,1,replace= TRUE)))
dice2 <-replicate(1000,(sample(1:6,1,replace= TRUE)))
sim <- c()
combined <- dice1+dice2
sim <- table(combined)/1000

```

Problem 4:
Multiplication table
```{r}
