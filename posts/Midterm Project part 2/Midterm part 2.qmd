#Easy problem

Problem 1:
List all of the odd numbers from 1 to 100.
you could use the seq() function
How could you do this without using the seq() function? Consider using the mod function %%, which evaluates whether or not there is a remainder when dividing one number by another.

```{r}
for (i in 1:100){
  if(i%%2)
    print(i)
}


```

Problem 2 :
Generate 100 random numbers within a specific range
runif can do this
```{r}

runif(100,1,100)

```

Problem 3:
Create a variable that stores a 20x20 matrix of random numbers
```{r}
random_num <-matrix(runif(400, min=3,max=45), nrow = 20, ncol=20)


```

Problem 1:
FizzBuzz
List the numbers from 1 to 100 with the following constraints.

```{r}
a <- c(1:100)
for (i in a){
  p
}
