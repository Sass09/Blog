#Easier problems

Problem 1: List all of the odd numbers from 1 to 100. you could use the seq() function How could you do this without using the seq() function? Consider using the mod function %%, which evaluates whether or not there is a remainder when dividing one number by another.

```{r}
for (i in 1:100){
  if(i%%2)
    print(i)
}


```

Problem 2 : Generate 100 random numbers within a specific range runif can do this

```{r}

runif(100,1,100)

```

Problem 3: Create a variable that stores a 20x20 matrix of random numbers

```{r}
random_num <-matrix(runif(400, min=3,max=45), nrow = 20, ncol=20)


```

#Harder problems

Problem 1: FizzBuzz List the numbers from 1 to 100 with the following constraints.

This question can be solved using for loop and if else statements

```{r}
fizzb <- c(1:100)
for (i in 1:length(fizzb)){
  fizzb[i] <-i
  if(i%%3 == 0 & i%%5== 0){
    fizzb[i] ="FizzBuzz"
  } else if (i%%3 ==0){
    fizzb[i] ="Fizz"
  }
else if (i%%5 ==0 )
  fizzb[i] = "Buzz"
}


```

Problem 2:

```{r}

a<-runif(10000000,0,100)
hist(a)




```

Problem 3: Assume that a pair of dice are rolled. Using monte carlo-simulation, compute the probabilities of rolling a 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, respectively.

```{r}

dice1 <- replicate(1000,(sample(1:6,1,replace= TRUE)))
dice2 <-replicate(1000,(sample(1:6,1,replace= TRUE)))
sim <- c()
combined <- dice1+dice2
sim <- table(combined)/1000

```

Problem 4: Multiplication table

Generate a matrix for a multiplication table. For example, the labels for the columns could be the numbers 1 to 10, and the labels for the rows could be the numbers 1 to 10. The contents of each of the cells in the matrix should be correct answer for multiplying the column value by the row value.

```{r}

multiplication_table <-matrix(NA, nrow=10, ncol=10)
colnames(multiplication_table) <- c("1", "2", "3" ,"4", "5", "6", "7","8","9","10")

rownames(multiplication_table) <- c("1", "2", "3" ,"4", "5", "6", "7","8","9","10")

for(i in 1:10) {
  for(j in 1:10) {
   multiplication_table[i, j] = (i*j)
  }
}



  
 

  

```

Problem 5:

snakes and ladders. how do you add in a representaion of the board, so that you change which square the player is on depending on whether they land on a ladder or snake.

try solving the problem in a simpler way . like maybe roll. dice for ladder

```{r}


save_rolls <- c()
for(sims in 1:1000){
    total_sum<-0
    number_of_rolls<-0
    curpos <-0
    ladder <- c(3:11, 6:17,9:18,10:12)
    snakes <- c(14:4, 19:8, 22:20, 24:16)
  while(total_sum < 25){
    total_sum <-total_sum+sample(c(1,2,3,4,5,6),1)
      if (curpos %in% snakes) {
       curpos <- curpos +1  }
      if (curpos %in% ladder){
       curpos <- curpos +1
  }
  number_of_rolls <- number_of_rolls+1

}
save_rolls[sims] <- number_of_rolls
}
mean(save_rolls)



```
