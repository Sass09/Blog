Understand rules for precedence (which options will apply if both are set.)\n\n  There is a couple of code chunks options that you can use for    some for example eval=false can be used to just display the      function and not evaluate. You can also have a code chunk at     the top of the document as well.\n\n10.\\ Write inline r code.\n\n    Today's date is 2023-02-15\n\n11.\\ Explain how the rendering environment is different from the Rstudio environment.\n  \n    Rstudio environment is more like about how it would look as a     website, but Rstudio environment shows all the values and the     objects assigned to them.\n\n\n12.\\ Be aware of more advanced quarto options for html documents, and try some of the options.\n\n    **Yes**\n",
